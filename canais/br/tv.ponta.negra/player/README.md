# afterglow

afterglow is a tool to create fully responsive and totally awesome video players from HTML5 video elements with as little effort as possible.

Learn more about the project on the project website: [http://afterglowplayer.com](http://afterglowplayer.com).

## Version 2.0 is coming

We are currently working on version 2, which will bring some bug fixes and some new features. As it is a complete rewrite and a change away from video.js, some things will change. We try to keep backwards compatibility, but minor things may change.

If you are depending on api methods, you might want to wait for the new version. Adapting existing projects will be quite easy, though. 

### Alpha version available

Want to get crazy? [Here](https://github.com/moay/afterglow/releases/tag/2.0.0-alpha11)'s an alpha release for testing (or [here](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/moay/afterglow@2d35f1ba15c8271d98ed3390c348b28284222045/dist/afterglow.min.js), if you like the CDN). Feedback welcome.

The [afterglow documentation](http://docs.afterglowplayer.com) would not be that cool without [readme.io](http://readme.io), who also sponsor the project with a free account.
